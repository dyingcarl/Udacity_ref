How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Usually typos are found in this way, in a more computer-side eyesight.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Easy to trace back and reverse any errors made accidentally

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    manually doing so can save space, keep the data usage to minimum, auto-save 
	can be more secure in case of forgetting doing so.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    have files save as a group can make them synchronized as one version by another
	which helps a lot while think about them as a project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git-log shows commits are made, git-diff shows the actual differences in those 
	versions of file;

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Just like files back-up. If things went wrong, I can always reverse it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Trace my lesson notes?(maybe)
